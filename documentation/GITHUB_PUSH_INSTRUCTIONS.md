# GitHub Push Instructions

## Create New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `LightBox` (or `LightBox-Optimized` if you want to distinguish it)
3. Description: "High-performance LED matrix controller for Raspberry Pi with WS2811 and HUB75 support"
4. Choose: Public or Private
5. DO NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click "Create repository"

## Push Your Code

After creating the empty repository on GitHub, run these commands:

```bash
# Add the remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/LightBox.git

# Push the code
git push -u origin main
```

## Alternative: Using SSH

If you have SSH keys set up with GitHub:

```bash
# Add SSH remote instead
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/LightBox.git

# Push the code
git push -u origin main
```

## What's Included

Your repository contains:
- ✅ Optimized implementation (40% performance improvement)
- ✅ Support for both WS2811 and HUB75 LED panels
- ✅ Platform detection (Pi Zero W, Pi 3B+, Pi 4, simulation)
- ✅ Web interface on port 5001
- ✅ Migration tools from old versions
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite
- ✅ Full documentation

## After Pushing

1. Update the README.md with your GitHub username in the clone URL
2. Add any GitHub-specific features you want:
   - GitHub Actions for CI/CD
   - Issues templates
   - GitHub Pages for documentation
3. Consider adding topics: `raspberry-pi`, `led-controller`, `ws2811`, `hub75`, `neopixel`
