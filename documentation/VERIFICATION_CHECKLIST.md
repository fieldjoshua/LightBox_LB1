# LightBox Optimization Verification Checklist

This checklist ensures all functionality is preserved after migration to the optimized implementation.

## Pre-Migration Baseline

Record these values from the original implementation:
- [ ] Current animation program: _____________
- [ ] Brightness level: _____________
- [ ] Speed setting: _____________
- [ ] Active color palette: _____________
- [ ] FPS achieved: _____________

## Core Functionality Tests

### 1. LED Matrix Control
- [ ] WS2811 LEDs illuminate correctly
- [ ] Serpentine wiring pattern works (if applicable)
- [ ] All 100 pixels addressable (10x10 matrix)
- [ ] No dead pixels or incorrect colors

### 2. Animation System
- [ ] Cosmic animation runs smoothly
- [ ] All migrated animations work:
  - [ ] rainbow.py
  - [ ] sparkle.py
  - [ ] solid.py
  - [ ] custom animations (list any)
- [ ] Frame counter increments properly
- [ ] No visual stuttering or tearing

### 3. Configuration Management
- [ ] Settings load from migrated settings.json
- [ ] Changes persist after restart
- [ ] Brightness control (0-100%)
- [ ] Speed control works
- [ ] Color palette switching

### 4. Web Interface
- [ ] Accessible at http://localhost:5001
- [ ] Real-time status updates
- [ ] Control panel responsive
- [ ] Animation switching works
- [ ] Settings changes apply immediately
- [ ] Performance metrics display

### 5. Hardware Controls (if connected)
- [ ] Mode button cycles animations
- [ ] Brightness buttons adjust levels
- [ ] Speed buttons change animation speed
- [ ] Preset button loads saved states
- [ ] OLED display shows status (if present)

### 6. Performance Improvements
- [ ] FPS meets or exceeds baseline:
  - [ ] Pi Zero W: 20+ FPS
  - [ ] Pi 3B+: 50+ FPS (WS2811)
  - [ ] Pi 3B+: 100+ Hz (HUB75)
- [ ] CPU usage reasonable (<80%)
- [ ] Memory usage stable (no leaks)
- [ ] Response time <100ms for controls

### 7. Platform-Specific Features

#### Pi Zero W
- [ ] Automatic optimization detected
- [ ] Target FPS set appropriately (20)
- [ ] No performance warnings

#### Pi 3B+ / Pi 4
- [ ] CPU isolation working (if configured)
- [ ] Higher FPS targets achieved
- [ ] HUB75 support available (if hardware present)

### 8. HUB75 Features (if applicable)
- [ ] Panel detected and initialized
- [ ] Hardware PWM active (GPIO4-GPIO18 jumper)
- [ ] No flicker at high refresh rates
- [ ] 64x64 resolution working
- [ ] Double buffering smooth

### 9. Error Handling
- [ ] Graceful degradation without hardware
- [ ] Simulation mode works
- [ ] Clear error messages
- [ ] Recovery from animation errors
- [ ] Web interface remains responsive

### 10. Migration Validation
- [ ] All settings migrated correctly
- [ ] Custom animations transferred
- [ ] No data loss from original
- [ ] Deprecation notices created
- [ ] Archive contains old code

## Performance Benchmarks

Record optimized performance:

| Metric | Original | Optimized | Improvement |
|--------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Average FPS | _____ | _____ | ____% |
| CPU Usage | _____ | _____ | ____% |
| Memory Usage | _____ | _____ | ____% |
| Frame Time | _____ | _____ | ____% |
| Power Draw | _____ | _____ | ____% |

## Test Commands

```bash
# Basic functionality test
sudo python3 lightbox.py

# Simulation mode test
python3 lightbox.py

# Performance monitoring
curl http://localhost:5001/api/performance

# Check all animations
for anim in animations/*.py; do
    echo "Testing $anim"
    # Change animation via API or buttons
    sleep 5
done

# Stress test (run for 1 hour)
sudo python3 lightbox.py &
sleep 3600
# Check for memory leaks, crashes

# Platform detection
python3 -c "from core.config import Config; c=Config(); print(c.platform_info)"
```

## Sign-off
